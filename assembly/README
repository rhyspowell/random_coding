This is the basics (get a 32 bit machine)

sudo apt-get install build-essential nasm

to build

nasm -f elf32 -o myfirst.o myfirst.asm
ld -o myfirst myfirst.o

./myfirst

dissassembling

run

ndisasm myfirst

as this dosent know what is elf code and what is data it all looks very confusing.

run
objdump -d myfirst

produce something similar to what was typed in but this only pickout the code to be run by the cpu but returns that in something called AT&T Syntax

run 
objdump -d -M intel-mnemonic myfirst

looks much more familiar but it still uses the 0x to denote hexadecimal numbers and replaces labels with numbers to show the exact location of data in the code
